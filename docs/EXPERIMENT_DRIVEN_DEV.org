#+TITLE: Experiment Driven Development (EDD) Policy
#+AUTHOR: Throwaway Agent Lab
#+DATE: 2025-11-23

* Overview

This repository follows an *Experiment Driven Development (EDD)* methodology. This approach prioritizes rapid exploration and validation of hypotheses before committing to long-term architectural decisions.

* Directory Structure

All experiments reside in the ~experiments/~ directory and follow a strict naming convention:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
experiments/
  ├── 001-pyodide-startup-time/
  │   ├── README.org       # Hypothesis, plan, results
  │   ├── bench.py         # Code for the experiment
  │   └── results.json     # Data
  ├── 002-redis-persistence/
  └── NNN-experiment-slug/
#+END_EXAMPLE

* The Workflow

1. **Hypothesis**: Start with a question. "Can we run Pyodide in under 100ms?" or "Is Redis faster than Postgres for this durable state?"
2. **Scaffold**: Run ~./experiments/new_experiment.sh <slug>~ to create the directory.
3. **Hack**: Write throwaway code in that directory. No need for perfect tests or linting yet.
4. **Measure**: Record the results in the experiment's README.
5. **Decide**:
   - *Success*: Refactor the core logic into ~src/~.
   - *Failure*: Document why it failed and leave the directory for historical reference.

* Naming Convention

- **Prefix**: Three-digit number (incrementing).
- **Slug**: Kebab-case description.
- **Example**: ~003-vfs-interception-patterns~

* Documentation Requirements

Every experiment directory MUST contain a ~README.org~ (or ~.md~) with:
- **Goal**: What are we trying to prove?
- **Method**: How did we test it?
- **Results**: Quantitative or qualitative outcome.
- **Conclusion**: Next steps (adopt, discard, iterate).
