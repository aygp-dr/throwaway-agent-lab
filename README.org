* Overview

*Throwaway Agent Lab* is an experimental research project exploring a new paradigm for AI agents: instead of relying on rigid, pre-defined tool definitions (like MCP), agents generate disposable, "throwaway" Python code to solve problems. This code executes in a secure, sandboxed WebAssembly environment (Pyodide).

This approach allows agents to leverage the entire Python ecosystem on the fly, effectively treating "Code as Tools."

* Core Concepts

** 1. Throwaway Code
Agents write single-use scripts to perform tasks. If the task is "analyze this CSV," the agent doesn't call a ~analyze_csv~ tool; it writes a Python script using ~pandas~ to do exactly what is needed.

** 2. Sandboxed Execution
All generated code runs inside *Pyodide* (CPython compiled to WebAssembly). This provides a strong security boundary, preventing the agent from accessing the host system, network, or sensitive data unless explicitly allowed via the Virtual File System.

** 3. Virtual File System (VFS)
The agent interacts with the outside world solely through files. API calls, database queries, and resource fetching are abstracted as file operations, allowing for rigorous interception and control.

** 4. Durable Execution
Complex workflows are managed through durable execution patterns (checkpointing state), allowing long-running tasks to pause, resume, and recover from failures without losing progress.

* Project Structure

- ~src/agent/~: Agent logic, planning, and execution loops.
- ~src/sandbox/~: Pyodide runtime environment and VFS implementation.
- ~src/tools/~: Minimal toolset (Describe, Help) to bootstrap the agent.
- ~experiments/~: Research protocols and benchmark definitions.
